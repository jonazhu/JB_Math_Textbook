A blockade was created which stopped the flow of humanitarian aid, closed banks, cut off internet and phone communication.  Effectively, Tigray was suppressed into a closed system.  Shortly after the war ended in November 2022, UNICEF reported over 2,000 schools were closed in Tigray and over 2 million students out of school, the majority for over 2 years.  Elementary school students' walk to school increased from 1 to 4 miles, and student to classroom ratios were over 400:1. Without blackboards, a teacher resorted to use of a large stone.\n",
