    " - <b>Syntactic analysis:</b> Does the grammar make sense? Is the text gramatically correct?\n",
    " - <b>Semantic analysis:</b> Are we aware of the meaning of the words in context?  Do we understand the structure, word interaction, and related concepts of the text?\n",

    " - <b>Named entity resolution:</b> How do we identify and extract entities (names, organizations, addresses and places) and relationships? \n",

    "   - <b>Sentiment analysis:</b> Can we classify text (like customer feedback) into positive and negative feedback?\n",

    "<h2>1.2 Levels of Processing</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In (almost) any language, there are distinct levels of a text we can focus on: <b>characters</b> are strung together to form <b>words</b>, which are put together into <b>sentences</b>, then <b>paragraphs</b>, <b>documents</b>, and a whole set of documents, or a <b>corpus</b>. In all these cases, we put multiples together to make the next level, and decisions in preprocessing at one level will inherently impact the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be focusing on using algorithms to process whole documents or anything above that level, so we can look at preprocessing at the remaining levels: characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>For characters</b>, we typically process textual data by removing special characters, punctuations, and normalizations. However, this is not necessarily the case for every NLP approach. In some cases, taking away these special characters, punctuations, and normalizations will completely alter the meaning of higher levels of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>For words</b>, we first have to define words within our text snippets. This is known as segmenting: in the English language, we can use white space to segment text into words. However, this is not always the case with other languages, so it is important to know the linguistic rules of the primary language you are working with. Additionally, we perform some removals and/or replacements for odd words such as abbreviations, acronyms, numbers, and misspelled words. Finally, we normalize our text data; this is typically done by stemming (covered later in this section) or lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>For sentences</b>, we first have to define sentence boundaries. In most languages, including English, sentences are started with a capital letter and ended with a period. However, periods and capital letters are also used within sentences, and captial letters or periods might not even exist in other languages, again stressing the importance of knowing the language's rules.  Within sentences, we can also mark phrases. In English sentences, we can typically label phrases of sentences with a subject, predicate, and object; the subject is the one performing the action, or predicate, on or directed towards the object. Finally, we parse the sentence, or tag the words with their respective part of speech. Note that this can only be done on the sentence level, not the word level, as the same word can have a different part of speech depending on how it is used in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, <b>for paragraphs</b>, our primary level of preprocessing is to understand the text by extracting the meaning of the text. This can include sentiments, emotions, intentions, etc. A good way of doing this is to perform abstractive summarization, or constructing new text that is similar in meaning to the old text. \n"

    "<h2>1.3 Procedures</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>1.3.1 Stemming </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by Martin Porter in 1980, the <b>Porter Stemmer</b> is the oldest and most commonly used stemming algorithm in many languages. It is slightly time consuming, so another stemming algorithm that can be used is the Lancaster stemmer. This stemmer is very aggressive, however, and is especially harmful for short tokens, where the token itself may become unclear or altered to a point where it loses meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, stemming is performed to help normalize our textual data; this is done so that we do not end up with many different words with very similar meaning. For example, stemming turns \"watch\", \"watched\", \"watching\", and \"watches\" into \"watch\". To do this, the algorithm accesses a database where known word forms, such as the various forms of \"watch\", are grouped together, then analyzes the text for all instances of these forms and turns them all into the root word. Stemmers also typically perform preprocessing tasks like turning words not at the beginning of a sentence into lowercase and removing stop words, which are common words like \"the\" and \"that\" which show up in a variety of contexts and typically do not change meaning across these contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are always irregularities when using any stemming algorithm. Take the following examples: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>\"I bought an Apple\" vs. \"I bought an apple\": Here, the stemming algorithm removed the capital on \"Apple\", but we can clearly see that this drastically altered the meaning; now, the speaker has bought a fruit instead of a product from the company Apple.  </li>\n",
    "<li>\"I watched <i>The Who</i>\" => remove stop words => \"I watched\": Here, the stemming algorithm removed the stop words \"the\" and \"who\", but this again changed the meaning of the sentence. Here, instead of watching the TV show <i>The Who</i>, the speaker has now watched something unspecified.</li> \n",
    "<li>\"Take that!\" => remove stop words => \"Take\": Like the above example, the stemming algorithm removed a stop word, \"that\". However, the sentence now loses all meaning: it is no longer a complete sentence, and without the \"that\" which served to add a violent, fighting intent to the original sentence, this emotion and intent is completely gone.\n",
