    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>The </span><span style='font-size:medium'>**probability**</span><span style='font-size:medium'> is the chance or likelihood that a given event will occur. For example, we can ask, \"What is the probability that it will rain tomorrow?\" Probability is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of probabilities.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>We quantify the probabilities of various events in this chapter. We do both mathematical analysis and computation. As in other fields of mathematics, mathematical understanding guides the choices of what to compute, and insights gained from computational exploration enhance mathematical understanding.</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Many areas of study involve random numbers. Examples include probability, computational science, data science, and statistics.</span>\n",

    "## <span style='font-size:medium'>Arbitrariness</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>When you tell a friend to \"Pick a number between 1 and 10,\" you may think you are telling the friend to pick a </span><span style='font-size:medium'>**random**</span><span style='font-size:medium'> number. However, for true randomness, each outcome 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 must be equally likely. It turns out that people have a preference, usually unconscious, for picking some numbers over others. Therefore, you are really telling the friend to pick an </span><span style='font-size:medium'>**arbitrary**</span><span style='font-size:medium'> integer between 1 and 10, rather than a random one.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "## <span style='font-size:medium'>Pseudo\\-randomness</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Even when computers do the choosing, most of time we should only say we have generated pseudo\\-random \\(fake random\\) numbers. A pseudo\\-random number generator, or PRNG, is a program that uses mathematical methods to </span><span style='font-size:medium'>**simulate**</span><span style='font-size:medium'> \\(mimic\\) randomness. </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>The basic process is to:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <span style='font-size:medium'>Provide the PRNG with an arbitrary seed \\(starting condition\\).</span>\n",
    "2. <span style='font-size:medium'>Ask the PRNG for the next \"random\" number. It is produced by a step\\-by\\-step, complicated, but not random, process.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Such a generator is also called a </span><span style='font-size:medium'>**deterministic**</span><span style='font-size:medium'> random bit generator. \"Deterministic\" means causally determined by preceding actions. The word \"deterministic\" is typically used in contrast to \"random.\"</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Sometimes, researchers use a cryptographically secure pseudo\\-random number generator \\(CSPRNG\\). A CSPRNG may sound like it uses true randomness \\(for strong security\\). However, you cannot safely assume that you have a completely fair \\(unbiased\\) \"coin flip\" or means of selection, even in this context. Fortunately, though, the prescriptive \\(deterministic\\) mechanism involved is hard to reverse, ensuring some measure of security. The key is to have a CSPRNG that is good enough for the application at hand.</span>\n",

    "<span style='font-size:medium'>In probability theory, the law of large numbers \\(LLN\\) says that the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected average and tends to become closer to the expected average as more trials are performed \\(based on the Wikipedia article on the LLN, citing A Modern 7 Introduction to Probability and Statistics by Dekking, 2005\\).</span>\n",

    "<span style='font-size:medium'>Problem. A single roll of a fair, six\\-sided die produces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, each with equal probability. Therefore, the expected value of the average of the rolls is \\(1 \\+ 2 \\+ 3 \\+ 4 \\+ 5 \\+ 6\\) / 6 = 3.5. According to the LLN, if a six\\-sided die is rolled a large number of times, the average value will approach 3.5 as the number of die rolls approaches infinity. Illustrate this idea using simulation with a larger and larger number of rolls.</span>\n",
