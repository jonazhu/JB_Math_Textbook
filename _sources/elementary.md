# Math on a Blackboard

One of the two main motivations for the original version of this book is to support the rebuilding of education in Tigray, Ethiopia.  After a horrific 2 year civil war ended in November 2022, UNICEF estimated over 2,000 schools were closed and 2 million children out of school (the majority for their 3rd year in a row.) Elementary school students walked 4 miles to school, with student to classroom ratios over 400:1.

:::{Note}
Whereas most of this book shows how JNBs can be used with Python programs, this chapter focuses on math concepts that can be illustrated with a simple blackboard.
