    "In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of data analysis and how to use Python to explore data for analytical purposes. The organization of this chapter is as follows: First, we will begin with an overview of data, describe the background of processing data, and explore various data types. Then, we will show how the Python programming language is used to prepare the data for analysis, including data importing and selection. Next, we will introduce common data operations used for statistics and analysis. Finally, advanced data operations with applications will also be presented. "

    "## 1. Exploring Data and Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several data-related research areas. A database researcher is interested in how data is stored and managed, whereas a data scientist focuses more on the topics such as methods of processing massive data, analyzing data from various sources, interpreting analyzed data, and visualizing the analytical results. Data analysis, in particular, has drawn attentions to statisticians, computer scientists, business people, health professionals, or even philosophers and artists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, data analysis was thought to be done by mathematicians only. Scholars often considered it in the domain of statistics. Today, however, new challenges motivate us to think of data analysis as a broad, multidisciplinary area. We use a variety of tools including computer programs to perform data operations. Due to the scope of this chapter and this book, we describe only a few facts of data and its related challenges in the era of modern data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "At present, scholars are dealing with large-scale data everywhere. For example, the Internet today has billions of webpages. According to the conservative estimates, there are at least three hundred billion emails that are sent daily. The need of analyzing such a great amount of data effectively has driven scientists to develop well-designed methods and to constantly update the hardware to increase the computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modern world generates data at a fast pace. Even if the data is from same source, numbers that are collected in the past can be very different from them at present. At the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and decision makers realized that the reported data of disease infections fell behind. The collected data for the daily reporting largely reflected what had happened in the past rather than what was happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysts are presented with structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data. One example of a structured dataset may be from a professor’s grade book. Students’ names and grades of all assignments are presented completely and accurately in a well-organized and cross-checked spreadsheet/table. Less or no additional effort of data \"re-structuring\" needs to be made. However, data from an ordinary person’s diary can be unstructured. The personal note has various lengths, covers different and unrelated topics, and is likely handwritten. Extracting data for an analytical process requires tremendous amount of data pre-processing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like water as the resource for people, agriculture, and industry, data is everywhere. However, just like water, the origin and the quality of data matter. The prevalence of data does not imply that all kinds of data can be used without scrutiny. An online survey result that was collected anonymously and assembled by a controversy business entity may be a less reliable but more biased source for data analytics. The clinical trial data submitted by the responsible medical professionals and peer reviewed by a reputable research group is thought be more trustworthy for academic purposes. The extent of data pre-processing depends on the source and the collection method of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various features of data due to the difference of dataset size, generation method, structure, and its sources. For analyzing data, several methods and challenges exist, too. The direction of data analysis can be predictive or descriptive:\n",
    "\n",
    "For *predictive* data analysis, one uses existing data to predict unknown and future data. For example, a credit card company can analyze the history of a user's credit card use to detect the potential fraud and possibly unauthorized transactions. An economist may analyze data from multiple sources to model the likelihood of a recession in the next few weeks or months. A climate scientist is able to create a model to predict the temperature trend from a region based on the historical pattern of the climate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *descriptive* data analysis, one performs analysis on available data in order to discover and better understand the features of the dataset. For example, a genealogist may use a program to analyze the people's face to tell how two individuals' look is similar to or different from each other. A business sales team may perform a market basket analysis from millions of transactions to discover the sets of frequently brought items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a data analysis method depends on not only the objective of analysis but also the type of data. An attribute of the data is here defined as a property or a feature of such kind of data. Generally speaking, there are four common types of data according to their attributes [cite: S. S. Stevens]. \n",
    "*Nominal* data is the names or values themselves, such as postal codes or identification numbers. \n",
    "*Ordinal* data affords a nartrual ordering or ranking, such as wine’s quality grades or customer’s satisfaction ratings.\n",
    "*Interval* data also can be ordered, but in this case the difference of data values is more explainable---calendar dates, for example.\n",
    "*Ratio* data can be meaningfully multiplied or divided, such as the distance between two locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data operations must be suitable for the specific data types. We can say that iron is about 7.8 times heavy of water (the density of iron is 7.87 g/m3; the density of water is 1 g/m3). However, it is wrong to do a simple arithmetic sum operation by saying the density of a mixture of iron and water is 8.8 (7.8+1) times heavy of water. In biology, a DNA molecule is composed of four types of bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These four bases are paired as A to T and G to C. However, we cannot just \"compare\" them to determine which base is \"larger\" or \"precedent\" of another, in the usual way as we do with natural numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part of this chapter, we will cover data analysis topics from executing common statistical tasks to building specific models for further analysis. We will demonstrate to the readers how to write Python programs relevant to the theoretical aspect of analysis. Moreover, we will discuss the benefits of utilizing computer programs when the data is processed with the help of Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Show three different sources of data in the real world and outline the main challenge of analyzing each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Explain how the increased volume of data creates additional difficulty for analyzing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Imagine that a system receives data at 5 Giga Bytes per second (i.e. 5GB/s) for a scientific project. However, the scientists must concurrently process all the data because the store-now-process-later option is unavailable. Moreover, these scientists do not find any single equipment that processes such a large amount of data at that speed. The only systems they have can process 1 GB of data per second (1GB/s). What is your solution to this data processing problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Does structured data have higher quality than unstructured data? If so, justify your answer. If not, give a counter example.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Give two of your own examples of predictive data analysis and descriptive data analysis in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) When researchers investigate a problem that needs data, they sometimes complain that the lack of data impedes their quality research. For instance, they are unable to tell which city or town will grow its population at what speed in the next decade if only one year’s population data is presented. That said, our general question is, does it hold true that \"the more data, the better for data analysis\"? Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) The four-category data attribute paradigm has limitations. One limitation is that some data’s attribute can hardly be put into any one of the four categories. Show an example of that kind of data and explain how its attribute is difficult to fit into any of the categories.\n"

    "## 2. Pre-processing and Post-processing Data: Importing and Exporting Data, and Data Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "For the complete process of data analysis, programmers usually follow the sequence of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Reading data from a file or from the user input  \n",
    "2 Processing loaded data, including re-organizing data, computations, and generating results  \n",
    "3 Outputting data to the computer screen or writing the output to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is pre-processing the data, that is, to prepare the \"clean\" data for analysis from the raw data. This step usually involves the loading of a dataset that is imported from databases, files, or the user inputs. The raw data can take various forms. As we have mentioned in the previous section, the data can be more or less structured. In this chapter, we will focus on the processing of structured datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "A structured dataset, according to this book's definition and its applications, is the one that is:\n",
    "1. linear, such as a collection of records with the same type, i.e. 1-dimensional data, or\n",
    "2. table-like, such as the records organized with complete information of rows and columns, i.e. 2-dimensional data, or\n",
    "3. cubiod-like, such as data points in a space, represented by three values, x, y, z, i.e. 3-dimensional data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the computer screen is \"flat\", i.e. 2-dimensional, and all data must be properly structured and saved into the memory space, we still need to convert the 3-dimensional data in a form that fits into a 2-dimensional data's view. There are several techniques that do such kind of 3D-to-2D conversion, but this topic is currently beyond the scope of our book. Therefore, we only introduce the methods of processing a file that is already saved with one dimension or two dimensions.\n"

    "On line 2, my_data is the object with the DataFrame format. It is used to be processed by the Pandas library according to the row and column information. pd.read_csv is the function from the Pandas library to read the .csv file. Enclosed in the function's parameter 'data.csv' is the file name (data.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your Python's workspace and the data file are in the same directory/folder, no further action is needed from this part. However, if the data file is stored elsewhere, we must specify the location of such a file in the Python code, such as:\n",

    "Note that the Python code for specifying a file location depends on the operating system the user is using. The first form is usually suitable for MacOS and Linux systems, where a forward slash (/) is used to go into a sub-directory. The second form is often seen in a system where a backward slash (\\) is used to go into a sub-directory, such as Microsoft Windows. Here, two backward slashes are used because Python processes the special character \\ with an escape character \\. The first \\ is for the formatting purpose to indicate that there is a special character coming next and the second \\ is the actual character to be read.\n",

    "Next, we describe the ways to export and present data. If the output is to the computer screen, Python’s `print()` function should have the need. If we want to output data to a file, we will use Python’s file writing functions. The following code can be used to write the data to a file. At this time, we also assume that the file is in a plain text format, which is more conventional and convenient for the data storage, other than a binary format, which is encoded for the use by a computer program and/or program instructions.\n",

    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we assume that all data have already been stored in a list. Since the file operation is to write to a file, we use the parameter \"w\" within the open() function to write data to a file. results.txt is the plain text file name that all data is written to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will process the for loop by accessing each element in the list one after one. In each iteration of the loop, the program executes the write() function by pushing one element into the file. The file writing function, write(), always needs to process strings only (the system treats the output as a long string) but the user generated data may not be strings. Just like in our example, we must convert the number type data, e.g. int, into a string type. Therefore, we use str() to do such a type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "After one element is written into the file, a white space is also written to the file before the loop repeats to write another element into the file. Finally, the program closes the file with the close() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code example works to output all data into a file, where all records are stored in one line only. What if the user intends to output data with multiple lines, where each line contains one record only? What if the user decides to save the output file in a different directory other than the Python program’s default working directory? We are leaving these questions to the readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next part of this chapter, we will introduce data visualization in Python. Data visualization transforms numerical data into a visual form. It facilitates both professionals and the general public to understand complex analytical results. There are several specialized Python libraries for data visualization, including Matplotlib, Plotly, and Altair.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may be interested in climate data visualization. One would find it easy to read the temperature changes and precipitation differences through charts instead of a string of numbers. In particular, we visualize the monthly climate data for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The related data source can be found from [the World Meteorological Organization](https://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=162).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our approach, we present the precipitation data with a bar chart and the temperature data with a line chart using the `matplotlib` library. The precipitation data is according to the average monthly rainfall in millimeters. The temperature data is according to the mean daily minimum temperature and the mean daily maximum temperature in Celsius (°C). The readings are monthly, from January to December.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precipitation: 13, 30, 58, 82, 84, 138, 280, 290, 149, 27, 7, 7\n",
    "- Daily high temperature:  24, 24, 25, 24, 25, 23, 21, 21, 22, 23, 23, 23 \n",
    "- Daily low temperature: 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 7, 7\n",

In our example, we use both a line chart and a histogram to represent a series of data. Both the line chart and the histogram are possible for displaying the differences between any two data points.

    "Data visualization is an important and interesting topic for data analysis. Due to the scope of this book, we will not elaborate more on this topic, nor will we explain more concepts and uses for a Python library. More information about the use of Matplotlib can be found from its official website: https://matplotlib.org/ .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write a Python program that can take a limitless number of user input values but let the program output a maximum of first 6 values. You can freely design and determine how the program takes each value and how it stops accepting user inputs. For example, if the user inputs 1, 2, 3, 4, the program outputs 1, 2, 3, 4. If the user inputs 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, the program outputs 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) There is a .csv file that stores data like a spreadsheet. There are 100 lines in total. Each line has 25 commas that are used to separate data. This .csv file also contains a title line (in the first row) and an index column (in the first column). The titles and indices are not part of the actual and meaningful data records. Only the remaining fields (i.e. data below the title line and right to the index column) are the actual data records. How many actual data records can this .csv file store?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Assume that an end user inputs a line of data. That line contains all numbers that are separated by comma. For example, the user input from the keyboard is:\n",
    "150,200,250,300,400,500,50,5,0,1,2\n",
    "There is a comma (no space) between any two numbers. There is no comma before the first number or after the last number. \n",
    "Write a Python program to read the entire line and parse the data in a way that treats the numbers separately. The program should produce the output with each number in one line, like the following:\n",
    "150\n",
    "200\n",
    "250\n",
    "300\n",
    "400\n",

    "50\n",
    "5\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "\n",
    "4) A well-formatted .csv file should have only one kind of data separator, such as commas. What if the original data file contains commas and semicolons both as data separators? Outline a method to correctly process that kind of file. \n",
    "\n",
    "[figure]\n",
    "\n",
    "5) This is a question specifically related to the system and programming platform that you intend to use. What kind of slash, / or \\, does your operating system use for file directories? Which of the following characters are accepted or not accepted in a file name, <, >, !, -, _, :, ;, ?, \\#, \\@, \\, by the Python program, and by the operating system ? Test them and get your answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) In our example of reading data from a multi-line file, we used the string’s slicing to remove the line break character \\n. Now, design a Python program to read the multi-line file and extract the actual content from the file, without using any slicing method for a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Write a new Python program or revise the existing Python code to make it load a list of data elements and write them into a plain text file. This time, different elements must be in a separate line. Hint: you can achieve the goal by still using the function write(). No other file writing functions need to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) If a statistician wants to analyze the data of total births by month in a region, i.e. January: 253, February: 229, March: 247, … What charts would you suggest to use in order to display the monthly records in data visualization? What type of chart is more suitable or less suitable, and for what kind of analysis purpose? Hint: this is a semi-open-ended question. The selection of a chart is determined by a set goal.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step in our data analysis process is reading the raw data from a file and loading it into the Panda’s DataFrame. Now, we assume that this step has been completed. Our next step is to operate on the data that is stored in the DataFrame for analysis. In this section, we will show the process of several basic statistical operations in Python. We operate data based on a dataset from a .csv file. The dataset we are using for demonstration is the world population data from the World Bank of the United Nations:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SM.POP.TOTL?downloadformat=csv\n",

Therefore, we should remove these unnecessary lines, thereby to make the title line \"Country Name\",\"Country Code\",\"Indicator Name\",\"Indicator Code\", …. as the actual first line of this .csv file. After removing the unnecessary lines as described, we save that file with a better-recognized name, for example, world_population.csv . \n",

    "print(population_raw_data)\n",

    "[figure]\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset contains many columns. Due to the size of the user’s screen and the text, displaying all titles in one single line is not automatic. Hence, the Jupyter notebook displays the columns in several sections.   \n",
    "\n",
    "ii)  Select data\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset is often so large that we do not want to display everything from it. Sometimes, we just want to take a glance at the structure of the dataset by viewing the first few rows. The following code is executed to display the first 5 rows of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "population_raw_data.head()\n",
    "\n",
    "[figure]\n",

    "If we do not put any number parameter in the head() method, the default display of the DataFrame is with the first 5 rows. If a specific number X is put as the parameter, e.g. population_raw_data.head(3), the first X (3) rows will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis does not need all of the data. Therefore, we may select a few rows and/or columns and present the data as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Particular rows may be selected for displaying purposes. For example, we may be interested in knowing the population values for a specific country or multiple countries, we can write the following code to select and display the related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "country_name = \"Ethiopia\"\n",
    "country_selected = population_raw_data.loc[population_raw_data['Country Name'] == country_name]\n",
    "print(country_selected)\n",
    "\n",
    "[figure]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The above code is for selecting a table’s row(s) based on conditions. In the second line, we have used the .loc expression to locate the rows. One can use it such as .loc[3] or .loc[10:20] where there are number values in the squared brackets to select rows according to their indices of the table. In our code, since we want to specify a selection of row for the country Ethiopia, we apply the expression population_raw_data['Country Name'] == country_name . The double equal sign == tells the program that we will select the row where there is a country name \"Ethiopia\" in the column Country Name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not always have to use == for the selection of a row. For instance, we may want to look at all countries and regions whose population is over 1 billion in the year of 2000. The following code does this job. Notice that > is used in the conditional expression.\n",

    "In order to select certain columns and display the data that are associated with those columns, we can write the following code: \n",
    "\n",
    "data_year1960 = pd.DataFrame(population_raw_data, columns = ['Country Name','1960'])\n",
    "print(data_year1960)\n",
    "\n",
    "[figure]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The above code uses Panda’s DataFrame function to \"create\" another DataFrame from the original one. The new DataFrame contains two columns only, one as 'Country Name' and the other as '1960'. data_year1960 is therefore also a DataFrame type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to note is that from a computer science's perspective, the index number for counting or for a collection of data starts with 0, not 1. As people generally say we read the first row, this row is reflected as row #0. This offset-by-one convention is applied almost everywhere in computing, including throughout the Python language. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should also note that Python can automatically recognize the data types from the data. When the Python program detects a number type, such as the population value, it automatically converts the whole number (i.e. integer) into a number with the decimal point (i.e. floating point number). Although the data that is represented with a floating point type seems to be unnecessary in this specific dataset, it may be helpful in certain calculations. Nevertheless, Python treats the two numbers, one as a whole number and the other as the number with the same whole number part plus .0, e.g. 1.0 and 1, equivalent in their numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the raw dataset contains fields that are without any number but with a space or nothing. Those fields that are supposedly filled in with a number-typed data will show NaN, which means \"Not a Number\".\n",

    "Option 1: Using Python's built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language itself carries multiple functions that can be used directly. These functions are called built-in functions in that a user does not need to explicitly write any code to import libraries and their functions from an external source. Usually, these functions are the ones that a programmer needs to use very frequently and basically, such as print(), int(), str(), etc. Some of the built-in functions are for mathematical calculations, such as max() and min().\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate the following built-in functions in Python, abs(), max(), min(), round(), sum():\n",

    "There are advantages and disadvantages of using Python's built-in functions for basic data analysis. On one hand, since no external library needs to be imported, the program is relatively easy to maintain. The use of these built-in functions is also relatively easy. On the other hand, there are a limited number of functions available to do statistical analysis. Existing built-in functions may not suitable to use for a uncommon data type unless a data type conversion is done.\n",

    "… \n",
    "There are similarities between the methods from several different Python libraries. However, there are technical differences even when these libraries share the same method names. The Python program needs to process the data collection correctly but it has to know first how the data are organized. Therefore, different tools must be used to handle the specific type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "… (feedback needed: I assume Pandas will be used throughout the chapter and even the entire book….? Or what else?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see from the above example, one advantage of using an available library to perform statistical analysis is convenience. A user does not have to have extensive training in Python programming to obtain a statistical result as long as such a function provides the need for the user. However, there are also disadvantages for using functions from any available libraries. All existing Python libraries must be maintained and possibly updated. When one Python library is imported, the user is usually not using many of its functions. There are also compatibility and configuration issues since no single library provides what the user needs completely and exactly. One may find that they use library A for one task, use library B for another task, and then have to write customized code for the rest of issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3: Writing the functions by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, researchers need to do data analysis that involves uncommon data structures and apply complex data operations. There is no available function for them to apply. In that case, one has to write their objective-driven function to meet the data analysis need. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some people may argue that writing a user-defined function gives the intended developers and users some degree of freedom. However, it is not recommended for a non-professional user to write a Python function from scratch when existing functions are available. Professional programmers have developed and thoroughly tested the code for the ordinary users to use. Writing such a standard function requires strong computer science background, including robust skills of computer programming plus abundant knowledge of algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "At present, we are not showing in detail the challenge of writing a standard function for a software reuse purpose. We will not address the cost of maintenance, either. We will leave the discussion as a question for the interested readers to ponder.\n",

    "1) Write one Python program that calculates the following values from a given set of numbers: 10301, 4994, 8872, 9624, 3666, 924, 73712, 3823, 55900, 62, 6498, 852, 24540, 421, 67891, 924, 80192, 3667, 494, 1788. You can choose any data structure for the storage and the processing of these numbers. You will then choose and apply any suitable functions for the calculations.\n",

    "a)the number count, i.e. how many elements in this set.\n",
    "b)the sum of all these numbers.\n",
    "c)the minimum value from this set.\n",
    "d)the maximum value from this set.\n",
    "e)the median value from this set.\n",
    "f)the mode of the elements in this set.\n",
    "g)the standard deviation from this set.\n",
    "h)the variance (defined as the square of the standard deviation from #7). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Since we know that we can use max() (or min() ) function to get the largest (or the smallest) number from a data collection, how can we get the second largest (or the smallest) number? Describe your method and write a Python program to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) From the question above, can you modify or extend to finding the nth largest or smallest number? Scribe your method and re-write the Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) As we know, mode() is used to get the number that appears most frequently in a data collection. Now, we would like to obtain the number that appears the second most frequently. Let's call that function second_mode(). Write a Python program to implement this user defined function. Hint: one or more existing functions for processing the DataFrame can be used to help building this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) In data analysis, researchers often face the situations that the provided dataset is not \"clean\". The raw data records may be missing, duplicated, incomplete, or incorrect. Given a set of data that contains some records that are wrongly typed or missing, you will develop a program to skip (\"ignore\") these wrongly recorded data and let the program proceed to calculate the max, min, median, and mode values.\n",
    "For example, the input data is [10, 25, 'a', 100,  , 0, True, 12.345], the program should first filter the 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements, i.e. 'a', (empty data), and True. Then, the program will perform the calculation based on the other 5 numeric data.\n",
    "Hint: in Python, there are functions that check if such a record is a number type, isdigit(), isnumeric(), or isdecimal(). You should select the appropriate function in the code implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) As we have mentioned previously, it is recommended to use existing functions rather than writing one's own for most common statistical analysis tasks. However, it is possible and sometimes necessary to write a Python function by the end user. The following questions will challenge you by letting you develop the Python functions:\n",

    "6.1) \"non-numeric median\" function. The function median() is used to calculate the median value from a data collection, such a function is provided by a Python library such as Statistics and Numpy. Unlike max() and min() functions, a limitation of that median() function is that it cannot process non-numeric values , e.g. characters. You will write a Python program to calculate the \"median character\" of a list that is comprised of several lower-case English letters. The median character is determined by the alphabetical order from a to z.\n",

    "\n",
    "6.2) Write a function that finds the duplicated elements in a data collection. Write a function, namely find_duplicates(), which finds all elements that appear more than once in a list. The function should output a list of each duplicated element once. For example,\n",
