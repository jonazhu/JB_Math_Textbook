In Fall 2020, Mr. Jim Wilkes, principal of Cornerstone Academy, an alternative Christian High School serving mainly low to middle income students on the West Side of Chicago held the pilot offering of Data Detectives via Zoom. A class of Wheaton College student mentors worked in small groups of 2 or 3 with Cornerstone students. Mr. Wilkes and Paul Isihara served as co-program directors, and Hope Wood and Antoinette Ratliff as program staff.
