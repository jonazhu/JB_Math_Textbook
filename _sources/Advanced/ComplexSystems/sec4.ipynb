    "The penal population is large and complex, and every individual in this population is different. The state of each offender (incarcerated, parole, not incarcerated, not on parole) is important and must be tracked. The macroscopic state (percentage in each category) while in flux, may be expected to approach a steady state in the absence of policy changes.\n",

Table 1 gives the probability that an individual will transition from one state to another in 1980 and also in 2005. Determining the steady state populations associated with these transition probabilities is one way to assess improvement or deterioration of the criminal justice system over this 25 year period. \n",

    "To this end, in 1980, the probability that someone on Parole (third row) transitioned to Not Incarcerated, Not on Parole was roughly .40; the probability that someone on Parole transitioned to being Incarcerated was .13; and the probability that a person on Parole remained on Parole was .47.  Notice that the sum .40+.13+.47 =1 since the three states are the only possible states to which a parolee can transition.  Each of the rows in the transition matrices must add to 1 for the same reason.  \n",

    "As a big scale `reality check', the U.N. spent millions of dollars to build a large IDP camp about 7 km southwest of Shire.  But none of the tens of thousands of IDP living in Shire (see <b> Figure 25</b>) wanted to move there since it was not within easy walking distance to the city where the IDP beg for food.  Furthermore, firewood was not available for cooking, and to compound matters, it was close to an army base, raising safety concerns. Plans which are not well-connected to the community/beneficiaries' needs and preference may look good on paper but in fact be unrealistic and result in a huge waste of time and material resources if implemented. \n",

    "From complex system theory we know that in some cases a transition can be catastrophic or irreversible. Our prayers are with the people of Tigray that the effects of the horrific civil war will be reversible in the sense that a stable and peaceful society will soon be restored. Our hope is that readers of this Module will be moved to participate in some way in an open system for the restoration of Tigray to the beautiful land that it once was.\n"
