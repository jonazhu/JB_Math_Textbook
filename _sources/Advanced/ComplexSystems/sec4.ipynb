    "### Incarceration and Parole\n",
    "The penal population is large and complex, and every individual in this population is different. The state of each offender (incarcerated, parole, not incarcerated, not on parole) is important and must be tracked. The macroscopic state (percentage in each category) while in flux, may be expected to approach a steady state in the absence of policy changes.\n",
    "Raphael [2011] describes a dynamical system categorizing the U.S. population into one of three states: (a) Not Incarcerated, Not on Parole, (b) Incarcerated, (c) Parole.  Table 1 gives the probability that an individual will transition from one state to another in 1980 and also in 2005. Determining the steady state populations associated with these transition probabilities is one way to assess improvement or deterioration of the criminal justice system over this 25 year period. \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, in 1980, the probability that someone on Parole (third row) transitioned to Not Incarcerated, Not on Parole was roughly .40; the probability that someone on Parole transitioned to being Incarcerated was .13; and the probability that a person on Parole remained on Parole was .47.  Notice that the sum .40+.13+.47 =1 since the three states are the only possible states to which a parolee can transition.  Each of the rows in the transition matrices must add to 1 for the same reason.  \n",

    "## Disorder in IDP Camps\n",
    "\n",
    "Between Nov 2020 and Nov 2022, the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia suffered a horrific civil war. At one point their were an estimated 2.5 million internally displaced people (IDP) out of a population of 6-7 million. Even a year after the Pretoria Peace agreement, fighting by tribal milita continued in western Tigray, leaving 1 million IDPs living in over 30,000 IDP camps scattered across most of Tigray. With insufficient resources to create humane living conditions in all the camps, a question arises as to which camps had the greatest need for outside humanitarian support? We will will address this question using the idea of entropy to obtain a simple quantitative measure of the amount of disorder within an IDP camp, and hence a way to rank camps by degree of disorder. We will then apply SAMI to account for camp size."
