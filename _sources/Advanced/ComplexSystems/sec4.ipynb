The state of each offender (incarcerated, parole, not incarcerated, not on parole) is important and must be tracked. The macroscopic state (percentage in each category) while in flux, may be expected to approach a steady state in the absence of policy changes.\n",

Table 1 gives the probability that an individual will transition from one state to another in 1980 and also in 2005. Determining the steady state populations associated with these transition probabilities is one way to assess improvement or deterioration of the criminal justice system over this 25 year period. \n",

    "To this end, in 1980, the probability that someone on Parole (third row) transitioned to Not Incarcerated, Not on Parole was roughly .40; the probability that someone on Parole transitioned to being Incarcerated was .13; and the probability that a person on Parole remained on Parole was .47.  Notice that the sum .40+.13+.47 =1 since the three states are the only possible states to which a parolee can transition.  Each of the rows in the transition matrices must add to 1 for the same reason.  \n",

    "One major problem with using Shannon entropy to measure deficiency is that it gives a misleading  result when there is a high probability that the students fail most or even all the tests.  For example, in the case of the worst deficiency where all students fail all 4 tests, $p_4=1$ (all other $p_i=0$) so $H=p_4\\ln p_4 = 1\\ln1=0$.  To analyze deficiency, we need a metric that increases with increased number of tests failed. We therefore use a weighted  Shannon for deficiency:\n",

    "The American Statistical Association (ASA) missional statement  to use statistics to enhance human welfare (Lesser 2007, Schram et al. 2018, Amdat 2022) encourages us to consider social justice datasets such as data on IDP in Tigray.  Entropy has flexible interpretations, and with suitable modification offers a metric  to assess the condition of IDP camp education for a given locale. Entropy is a topic not usually covered in an intro to stats or data science class, or even within a traditional math major, but takes histogram analysis one step further.   In the case of our IDP data, there are several other important categories such as food, water and health that could be explored  in a similar way using Jupyter Notebooks. Thinking in general about various intepretations of entropy in societal contexts and use of the IDP dataset in particular gives an opportunity to enact several Gaise (2016) recommendations including: teaching  statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making, focusing on conceptual understanding, integrating real data with a context and purpose, fostering active learning, and using technology to explore concepts and analyze data.
