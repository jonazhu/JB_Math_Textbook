    "## 1.2 Levels of Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In (almost) any language, there are distinct levels of a text we can focus on: **characters** are strung together to form **words**, which are put together into **sentences**, then **paragraphs**, **documents**, and a whole set of documents, or a **corpus**. In all these cases, we put multiples together to make the next level, and decisions in preprocessing at one level will inherently impact the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be focusing on using algorithms to process whole documents or anything above that level, so we can look at preprocessing at the remaining levels: characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For characters**, we typically process textual data by removing special characters, punctuations, and normalizations. However, this is not necessarily the case for every NLP approach. In some cases, taking away these special characters, punctuations, and normalizations will completely alter the meaning of higher levels of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For words**, we first have to define words within our text snippets. This is known as **segmenting**. In the English language, we can use white space to segment text into words. However, this is not always the case with other languages, so it is important to know the linguistic rules of the primary language you are working with. Additionally, we perform some removals and/or replacements for odd words such as abbreviations, acronyms, numbers, and misspelled words. Finally, we normalize our text data; this is typically done by **stemming** (covered later in this section) or **lemmatization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For sentences**, we first have to define sentence boundaries. In most languages, including English, sentences are started with a capital letter and ended with a period. However, periods and capital letters are also used within sentences, and capital letters or periods might not even exist in other languages, which again highlights the importance of knowing the language's rules.  Within sentences, we can also mark phrases. In English sentences, we can typically label phrases in sentences with a subject, predicate, and object; the subject is the one performing the action, or predicate, on or directed towards the object. Finally, we parse the sentence by tagging the words with their respective part of speech. Note that this can only be done on the sentence level, not the word level, as the same word can have a different part of speech depending on how it is used in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **for paragraphs**, our primary level of preprocessing is to understand the text by extracting the meaning of the text. This can include sentiments, emotions, intentions, etc. A good way of doing this is to perform abstractive summarization, which involves constructing new text that concisely captures the meaning of the old text."

    "As mentioned previously, stemming is performed to help normalize our textual data by reducing tokens to their base forms. This is done so that we do not end up with many different words with very similar meaning. For example, stemming turns \"watch\", \"watched\", \"watching\", and \"watches\" into \"watch\". To do this, the algorithm accesses a database where known word forms, such as the various forms of \"watch\", are grouped together. It then analyzes the text for all instances of these forms and turns them all into the root word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemmers also typically perform preprocessing tasks like turning words not at the beginning of a sentence into lowercase and removing **stop words**, which are common words like \"the\" and \"that\" which show up in a variety of contexts and typically do not change meaning across these contexts. The `NLTK` library contains a set of English stop words, which the following code prints out. Notice how many of these stop words are common words like pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions."
