Because data is usually incomplete and has a lot of variability, this decision making process inherently contains a lot of uncertainty. But the difficulty shouldn't deter us! The statistical decision-making process is based on a robust theory of probability, and one of the easiest ways to illustrate this theory is using computation. \n",
